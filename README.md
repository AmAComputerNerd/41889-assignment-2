**EF 4 explanation:** For my extended functionality 4, I chose to implement Special Bubble Abilities. When a bubble is generated, it has a 10% chance to have a special ability. These include:
- Bomb (5%): will pop all bubbles within a certain range around it.
- Mimic (4%): will change colours at random throughout the game.
- Screen clearer (1%): will pop all bubbles on the screen at once.
